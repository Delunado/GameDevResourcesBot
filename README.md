# Game Dev Resources Bot

### What is Game Dev Resources Bot?
This is a little Telegram Bot which manages messages, receiving and sending them to a Telegram Channel about Game Development Resources. There are two principal elements:

- [The Channel](https://t.me/recursosgamedev): Everyone can send messages here through the Bot. The idea is to send here links and resources about game development.
- [The Bot](https://t.me/recursosgamedevbot): Anyone who wants to send a message to the channel, must do it through the Bot. The Bot only supports text messages (not pictures nor audio, etc.). The Bot manages the messages, allowing only to send 3 messages per hour to each user.

If you want to participe in [The Channel](https://t.me/recursosgamedev), you just have to join it, then go to [The Bot](https://t.me/recursosgamedevbot), and send anything you want to. Simple and fast!

It is not permitted to send spam, sexual content, violent content, etc.
